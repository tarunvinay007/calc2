    <p><span>Factory </span></p>

    <p>

        In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating other objects, formally a factory is
        a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class from some method call, which is
        assumed to be 'new'.

    <p><span>Instantiation</span></p>
    <p> Instantiating a class is creating a copy of the class which inherits all class variables and methods.
        Instantiating a class in Python is simple. To instantiate a class, we simply call the class as if it were a
        function, passing the arguments that the _init_ method defines.
    </p>
</div>



<div class="section">
    <p><span>Object</span></p>
    <p>
        An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with
        actual values. Python is object oriented programming language which stress on objects i.e. it mainly emphasize
        on functions.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><span>Class</span></p>
    <p>
        'Class' is a logical grouping of functions and data. Python class provides all the standard features of
        Object Oriented Programming. In Python, a class can inherit attributes and behavior methods from another
        class called subclass or heir class.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <p><span>Namespace</span></p>
    <p>
        In python, A namespace is a collection of currently defined symbolic names along with information
        about the object that each name references. You can think of a namespace as a dictionary in which the keys are
        the object names and the values are the objects themselves.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><span>Constructor</span></p>
    <p>
        Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is to
        initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. In Python
        the _init_() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><span>Fixture</span></p>
    <p>
        Fixtures define the steps and data that constitute the arrange phase of a test.
        In pytest, they are functions you define that serve this purpose. They can also be used to define a test's act
        phase; this is a powerful technique for designing more complex tests.

    <p><span>Type Hint</span></p>
    <p>
        Type hinting is a formal solution to statically indicate the type of value within your Python code. It was
        specified in PEP 484 and introduced in Python 3.5. Here's an example of adding type information to a function.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><span>Type cast</span></p>
    <p>
        Type casting is a method used to change the variables or values declared in a certain data type into a different
        data type to match the operation required to be performed by the code snippet. In python, this feature can be
        accomplished by using constructor functions like int(), string(), float(), etc.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><span>Unit test</span></p>
    <p>
        The unit test framework in Python is called unittest, which comes packaged with Python. Unit testing makes your
        code future proof since you anticipate the cases where your code could potentially fail or produce a bug.
        Though you cannot predict all the cases, you still address most of them.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><span>Static</span></p>
    <p>
        The static variable and static method are the widely used programming concepts in various languages such as
        C++, PHP, Java, etc. These variables and methods belong to the class and the objects. In this section, we will
        learn how we create static variables and methods in Python.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><span>Class method</span></p>
    <p>
        A class method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class. They have the access to
        the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance. It
        can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class.
    </p>

    <p><span>Facade</span></p>
    <p>
        Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of
        classes, library or framework. While Facade decreases the overall complexity of the application, it also helps
        to move unwanted dependencies to one place.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <p><span>Design patterns</span></p>
    <p>
        Design Patterns is the most essential part of Software Engineering, as they provide the general repeatable
        solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. They usually represent some of the best practices
        adopted by experienced object-oriented software developers.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><span>Method</span></p>
    <p>
        A method is a function that 'belongs to' an object. (In Python, the term method is not unique to
        class instances, other object types can have methods as well. For example, list objects have methods called
        append, insert, remove, sort, and so on.
